     Project has websocket and AJAX used so it is quite responsive. Organizations can be shared/unshared,
     attached/detached. Whenever an organization is attached, notifications
     are sent if under time limit user determined. Also the devices can be turned on if they have part in it and none of
     the parts have 0 time. Whenever parts are checked when device is on, it can be seen the time left changes every
     second. In addition, notifications are sent if the part is below limit. Note that notifications are sent every second
     and for every part for testing purposes. For each user, the notification that they receive is distinct and dependent
     on their settings.
